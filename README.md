Stock-Analysis
==============

A Stock Analysis Framework based on model for machine learning practice.

One problem of studying machine learning is lacking sufficient real-word data to training models and validating results that models predict. 
The stock market which provide plenary data to public can solve this problem. 
Thus, I write this framework, which automatic download stock data and put it to various models to predict stock price, to help me study machine learning.
It is my pleasure if it helps you too.
